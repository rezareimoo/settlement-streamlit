## 🔐 Database Configuration

The application connects to:
- **Host:** settlementanalyticsdb.postgres.database.azure.com
- **Database:** Settlement
- **Port:** 5432
- **SSL:** Enabled

Connection pool settings:
- Max connections: 20
- Idle timeout: 30 seconds
- Connection timeout: 10 seconds

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16.0.0 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.x
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** Radix UI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via pg library
- **Charts:** Recharts (ready for integration)
- **Maps:** react-simple-maps (ready for integration)

## 📝 Key Achievements

1. **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage ensures fewer runtime errors
2. **Performance:** Server-side rendering and API routes improve load times
3. **Scalability:** Modular architecture allows easy feature additions
4. **Maintainability:** Clean code structure with separation of concerns
5. **Modern Stack:** Uses latest web development best practices

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. The `.env.local` file contains database credentials - keep it secure
2. Charts are placeholders - Recharts integration is ready but not implemented
3. The app uses React 19, which required `--legacy-peer-deps` for some packages
4. All database operations go through API routes (not direct connections)
5. The build process takes ~3 seconds and completes successfully
